- Made parent dashboard work, with some bugs. Then switched to SQLite to deploy more easily and the app broke down again (SQLite supports JSON instead of arrays from postgreSQL). I need to debug this in the morning as I'm too tired at 8:43pm (Stella woke up at 5am)
- ClassSelector on parent dashboard didn't work as intended. Fixing was complicated.
- Amir told me I can also deploy on my local computer, using it as a server. I spent some time setting a fixed IP address. Sona told me Netlify has 3 projects for free.
- The code is a mess. I might want to rethink it and implement from scretch as it's getting too long to do any change.
- Make the existing code base work on SQLite and try to deploy.

20241211:
- worked on Klasstra, teacher dashboard
- my pervious work on parent dashboard broke the reused endpoints
- last night I over-complicated the registration flow and couldn't make it work. Today I simplified by kicking out profile from it.
- keep it simple; when de-bugging, ask chatGPT to put detailed logs into the file, then paste console content into it, which will give much better feedback and will speed up resolving the issue by chatGPT. It has its limits at identifying issues in a larger file (200 lines) or multiple files.
- finish the core functionality and start production deployment
